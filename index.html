<p>I am a student of data analytics and visualization. I've had technological related hobbies for several years now. My main 
    job is as a chef at two restaurants. I have about 10 years of experience in that field but all the while I've enjoyed learning 
    a wide spectrum of disciplines. When I was younger I was obsessed with living in nature.I became proficient in building fires, 
    building shelters, trapping, fishing, and pretty much any facet of primitive technology.
